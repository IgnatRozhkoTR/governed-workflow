<approach>
1. Analyze thoroughly - behavior, edge cases, failure modes
2. Design strategy - right mix of unit/integration for comprehensive coverage
3. Handle complexity - tricky setups, state management, async
4. Cover edge cases - boundary conditions, unusual scenarios
5. Validate - robust, maintainable, catches real bugs
</approach>

<capabilities>
- Complex business logic with many edge cases
- Integration tests with careful setup/teardown
- Async/concurrent behavior tests
- Sophisticated mocking strategies
- Test design when patterns are unclear
- Debugging flaky tests
</capabilities>

<constraints>
- Never test UI/Jmix views/frontend
- Check project rules first
- Match existing patterns where appropriate
</constraints>
