# Claude Governed Workflow

A zero-trust orchestration layer for Claude Code that enforces phase progression, scope constraints, and human approval gates on agentic coding sessions. Instead of letting the agent self-certify its work, every phase transition is validated server-side — research must be proven, file edits are scope-locked, and critical checkpoints require explicit human approval through the admin panel.

The system ships as a set of Claude Code extensions: agent definitions, hook scripts, skills, and a Flask-based admin panel with an MCP server.

## How It Works

The workflow moves through assessment, research, planning, execution, review, and delivery. Four transitions are **user gates** that halt progress until a human approves or rejects via the admin panel.

Hexagonal nodes are **user gates** — the workflow pauses until a human approves or rejects. Diamond nodes are validation checkpoints. Rectangular nodes advance automatically when their criteria are met.

## Key Concepts

**Phase advancement.** The agent calls `workspace_advance` — the backend decides the next phase. Each phase has an advancer that validates prerequisites (progress documented, research proven, scope changes present, commit hash valid). Failures return specific errors explaining what's missing.

**User gates.** Preparation Review (1.4), Plan Review (2.1), Code Review (3.N.3), and Final Approval (4.2) generate cryptographic nonces. Only the admin panel UI can present them, ensuring the agent cannot self-approve.

**Scope locking.** Each execution sub-phase defines `must` (required changes) and `may` (permitted boundary) file patterns. Pre-tool hooks enforce these at edit time — the agent physically cannot write outside its scope. Scope and plan carry separate approval statuses. Updating either one auto-revokes its approval, requiring the user to re-approve before execution can continue.

**Research proving.** Researchers save findings with typed proofs (code:file:line, web:url, diff:commit). A separate prover agent verifies every proof before the workflow continues. No unproven claims pass. Rejected entries must be re-researched and re-proven before the workflow is allowed to advance past the research proving phase.

**Research discussions.** The agent posts research questions during assessment. Each question must be linked to at least one research entry before the workflow can advance past the research phase. Users can review questions, add their own, and reply in threaded discussions.

**Acceptance criteria.** During assessment and planning, the agent proposes acceptance criteria (unit tests, integration tests, BDD scenarios, custom checks) via MCP. Users accept or reject them in the admin panel. On the last execution commit, the server programmatically validates test-type criteria — it checks that named test methods actually exist in the specified test files. Plan approval is blocked if any criteria remain unresolved.

**Verification profiles.** Automated code quality checks that run at phase validation (3.N.1). Each profile targets a language or toolchain (Java Gradle, Python, TypeScript, etc.) and contains ordered steps: compilation, formatting, linting, static analysis. Each step has an install check command, an auto-install command, and a fail severity (blocking or warning). Profiles are global — not workspace-specific — but assigned per-workspace. The system ships with 4 preset profiles; users can create custom ones via the admin panel or setup wizard.

**Plan structure.** The execution plan includes system diagrams (class diagram and sequence diagrams in Mermaid) and tasks organized into sub-phases. Tasks can declare parallel groups for fork/join execution. Each sub-phase has its own scope (must/may file patterns), so different sub-phases can touch completely different parts of the codebase.

**Execution sub-phases.** The plan defines N sub-phases (3.1, 3.2, ...), each cycling through Implementation, Validation, Fixes, Code Review, and Commit. Production code and tests are always written by separate agents to maintain objectivity.

**Agent roles.** The orchestrator coordinates 16 specialized agent roles. A plan-advisor runs as a persistent teammate across the entire session. Production code and tests are always written by separate agents — engineers never write tests, test engineers never write production code. Phase 4.0 reviewers work blind with zero implementation context.

**Review system.** All review feedback — user comments, agent findings, and blind reviewer issues — lives in a single `discussions` table with `scope='review'`. Each review item carries a `resolution` status (`open`, `fixed`, `false_positive`, `out_of_scope`). Agents set the resolution after addressing feedback; users resolve items in the admin panel. A cross-cutting `ReviewGuard` blocks phase advancement until all review items are user-resolved. This applies to execution phases (3.N.K), address & fix (4.1), and final approval (4.2).

**Session recovery.** When a session ends (context compaction or restart), all teammates are lost. The orchestrator re-spawns them using progress entries that document what happened at each phase — actions taken, obstacles hit, decisions made, files changed.

**Telegram integration.** Sessions can be controlled remotely via a Telegram bot. The Telegram module replaces the default plugin with a custom multi-session server, allowing multiple Claude Code sessions to share one bot — each session prefixes replies with its workspace name (e.g., `[mp-72]`). Telegram users can list active sessions with `/sessions` and switch between them with `/switch <name>`. Orphan detection ensures that if the polling session dies, another session auto-recovers within seconds. Setup: `/telegram-multi-session install`.

**Modules.** Self-contained feature packages that live at `<repo>/claude/modules/`. Each module is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` and any supporting files the module needs. Modules are discoverable — the admin panel scans the directory for available modules. Users enable or disable modules via the Setup page or the Modules card on the dashboard. The system currently ships with the Telegram module for remote session control.

**Setup wizard.** Accessible from the project selector page in the admin panel. Configures modules and verification profiles in one go. Launches Claude Code in an embedded terminal and follows the setup skill to install selected modules, verify required tools, and create or assign verification profiles.
