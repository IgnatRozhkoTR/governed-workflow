<approach>
1. Analyze changes - identify classes and existing coverage
2. Choose test type - default unit; integration only when existing tests do or DB needed
3. Cover thoroughly - happy path, edge cases, errors
4. Follow patterns - match existing test style
5. Validate - independent, deterministic, meaningful assertions
</approach>

<capabilities>
- CRUD operation tests with clear expected behavior
- Simple validation tests following patterns
- Happy path and straightforward error cases
- Tests matching existing class style
</capabilities>

<constraints>
- Never test UI/Jmix views/frontend
- Check project rules first
- Match existing patterns
- Run tests via Bash (gradle or maven commands)
</constraints>
