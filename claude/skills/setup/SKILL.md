# Setup — Workspace Configuration Assistant

This skill is invoked automatically by the admin panel's setup wizard. It receives a configuration payload describing which modules to install and which verification profiles to configure.

## Input

The setup configuration is passed as the initial prompt. It contains:
- **modules to enable**: List of module IDs to enable (e.g., `["my_module"]`)
- **modules to disable**: List of module IDs to disable (e.g., `["other_module"]`)
- **languages**: List of language profile configurations to set up

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Module Configuration

For each module in the `modules to enable` list:

1. Read the module's skill file at `<repo>/claude/modules/<module_id>/SKILL.md`
2. Read the skill thoroughly — understand its `enable` section before doing anything
3. Follow the `enable` instructions exactly as written in the skill (the `enable` command handles install if needed, then activates the integration)
4. If the skill defines a `status` command, run it after enabling to verify success
5. If enabling fails:
   - Capture the full error output
   - Report it clearly: what failed, what the error was, what the user can do
   - Continue to the next module — do not abort the entire setup

For each module in the `modules to disable` list:

1. Read the module's skill file at `<repo>/claude/modules/<module_id>/SKILL.md`
2. Read the skill thoroughly — understand its `disable` section before doing anything
3. Follow the `disable` instructions exactly as written in the skill
4. If disabling fails:
   - Capture the full error output
   - Report it clearly: what failed, what the error was, what the user can do
   - Continue to the next module — do not abort the entire setup

### Phase 2: Verification Profile Validation and Setup

Detect the device environment before processing any profiles:
- Run `uname -s` to determine OS (Darwin = macOS, Linux = Linux)
- On macOS, check if `brew` is available (`which brew`)
- On Linux, identify the package manager (`which apt`, `which dnf`, `which pacman`)
- Note the detected environment — it will affect install commands throughout this phase

#### For Preset / System Profiles

For each selected preset language profile:

1. Check if a matching verification profile already exists via MCP workspace tools
2. If it exists, do not recreate it — proceed to validate it
3. **Validate each step in the profile actually works on this device:**
   - Run the step's `install_check_command` (e.g., `which java`, `which python3`)
   - If the check fails (tool not found):
     - Run the step's `install_command` to install it
     - If the install command fails, inform the user clearly: what tool is missing, what command was attempted, what they need to do manually (e.g., download from official site, accept a license, log in)
   - After installation (or if already present), run a quick smoke test of the main command to confirm it works:
     - e.g., `java --version`, `python3 --version`, `node --version`, `go version`
   - If the smoke test fails despite the tool being "installed", report the specific output and warn the user
4. Check whether the profile's commands are compatible with this device:
   - Watch for hardcoded paths that may not exist (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/...` on macOS with Apple Silicon vs Intel)
   - Watch for Linux-only or macOS-only commands
   - If a command references a path or tool that doesn't exist on this device, warn the user and suggest what needs to be adjusted
5. Assign the profile to the workspace after validation

#### For Custom Language Configurations

For each custom language configuration:

1. Create the verification profile via `workspace_create_verification_profile` MCP tool.
2. For each tool specified in the configuration:
   - If `install_check_command` is not provided, auto-detect it: use `which <tool>` as the default
   - If `install_command` is not provided, auto-detect based on OS and package manager:
     - macOS with brew: `brew install <tool>`
     - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install -y <tool>`
     - Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install -y <tool>`
   - Add the tool as a verification step via `workspace_add_verification_step` MCP tool
   - Run the `install_check_command` to verify the tool is present
   - If the tool is missing:
     - Run the `install_command`
     - If it fails, explain what the user needs to do manually (license acceptance, account creation, manual download, etc.)
   - Run a smoke test of the tool to confirm it works end-to-end
3. Assign the profile to the workspace

### Phase 3: Final Verification

1. List all configured modules and their status (enabled / disabled / failed / skipped)
2. List all configured verification profiles with the status of each step:
   - Step name, install check result, smoke test result
3. Run a quick verification pass of each profile to confirm all steps pass cleanly
4. Report a summary:
   - What succeeded
   - What failed or is degraded
   - Any manual actions the user needs to take, listed clearly and specifically

## Module Directory Structure

Modules live at `<repo>/claude/modules/`. Each module directory contains:
- `SKILL.md` — The skill definition with install/configure/status instructions
- Additional files needed by the module (scripts, configs, etc.)

## Verification Profile Configuration

When creating custom verification profiles, each language configuration includes:
- `name` — Profile display name (e.g., "Go")
- `language` — Language key (e.g., "go")
- `tools` — List of tools to add as verification steps, each with:
  - `name` — Step name (e.g., "Compilation")
  - `command` — The verification command (e.g., `go build ./...`)
  - `install_check_command` — Command to check if tool is installed (e.g., `which go`)
  - `install_command` — Command to install the tool if missing
  - `fail_severity` — `"blocking"` or `"warning"`

## Important Notes

- Profiles are global, not workspace-specific — they apply across all projects once configured
- Be adaptive to the device: never assume a fixed OS, package manager, or binary location
- Never skip a failure silently — always report what happened and what the user can do about it
- If the user needs to take a manual action (accept a license, log in to a registry, download a proprietary SDK), explain exactly what to do with enough detail that they can act without guessing
- This skill should minimize interaction, but it must not hide problems behind false success messages
